[inverter based PWM](https://www.robotroom.com/PWM.html)

Can generate pwm with diode caoacitora nd varableresistor, where r determens the duty cycle

555 Timmer commonly used, but >[[Amplifers#^3f6317||60-200MHz]] is to high (555 max is a few hundred KHz)

Three stage opamp and comparator [PWM generator](https://www.ti.com/lit/an/sboa212a/sboa212a.pdf?ts=1726492322125&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F) design

Simple [resistor-diode-capacitor-inveter](https://www.robotroom.com/PWM.html) design, obs i couldn't simulate

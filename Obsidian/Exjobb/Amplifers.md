[Power amplifer overview 2020](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9766331)
* Analog
* Switching 
	* If high frequency is hard then parralel low frequency with phase shift possible
		* [sigma delta buck](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6159064)
* Combination (Switch for high power, with analog for fast response and minimize overshoot)
	
[D - E -EF compare](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10119623)
[E- EF](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8318900) Verry nice


[Swith-cap](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6009207) amplifiers more efficient but not my concern

* Need higher freq for switching. 3-10 x max output freq -> 60-200MHz ^3f6317

Analog amplifier possable, due to low power and no need for high effiecency. But Switching is easy and work in more general case so i like it
